Maybe their house looks cluttered, but they still know where everything is. Everything has its place. Virgos prefer to exist in organized spaces, but put their service orientation over their own comfort. This can mean that a Virgo is too busy fixing the lives of those around them to put much work into providing for their own needs. They\’re rarely motivated by their own self-interest."

They remove your skin with their perceptive scalpel and take inventory of your pulsing viscera. They probe and push. They know the little things that make you tick. Your pressure points.

Sagittarius knows that external knowledge can be easily gained while internal knowledge is exponentially deeper and more powerful. They\’re on a quest to delve into the depths of the universe inside the human mind.

The alienation they feel is often self-imposed—a result of their knee-jerk contrarianism, rather than a lack of social intelligence. They try to be weird.

Pisces are just permeable membranes that pensively let things flow through them. They are cerebral sea sponges. They are boundless. They tend to dilute themselves with larger personalities to avoid having to form coherent identities. Most of the qualities usually associated with Pisces (dreaminess, emotionality, imagination) are internal processes that are difficult to observe from the outside. This is because Pisces are primarily inward-facing. They are not self-absorbed, but they are absorbed in themselves."
